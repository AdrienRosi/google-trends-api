#An API layer ontop of google trends

##Installation
To install this package, clone this git repository and include it in your project's node_modules or simply:

`npm install google-trends`

Require google-google trends in your script and give it a variable name:

`var googleTrends = require('PATH_TO_NODE_MODULES/google-trends/')`

You will now be able to access the googleTrends methods in your script.  See the [API section](##API) below to see the methods available and how they work.

##API
The following methods are available on your variable set to `require('PATH_TO_NODE_MODULES/google-trends/')`.  In other words, if `var googleTrends = require('PATH_TO_NODE_MODULES/google-trends/')`, then you have access to `googleTrends.METHODNAME()`.

For all the examples, the assumption is that `var googleTrends = require('PATH_TO_NODE_MODULES/google-trends/')`.  

For each of the API methods, rather than providing the parameters to the function in a specific order such as `googleTrends.topRelated('keyword', 'country')`, you can provide the function with an "options" object.  Keys that are not required for the method are simply ignored.  The available keys of the options object are as follows:

* geo: 'country code provided as a string',
* date: 'date provided in format yyyymm as a string where January starts at 01,
* category: 'a string for a specific category',
* keywords: 'either an array of keywords as strings or a singular keyword as a string'

**Note:** Google may limit the number of requests you can make in a specific amount of time.  If that happens, an error will be returned stating, "Quota limit exceeded, try again later"

The following API methods are available:
* [topRelated](###topRelated()): returns the top related keywords to a provided keyword or an array of keywords along with it's percentage of correlation.
* [hotTrends](###hotTrends()): returns the current top 20 trending searches for a given location.
* [top30in30](###top30in30()): returns the top 30 searches in the past 30 days
* [allTopCharts](###allTopCharts()): returns the top trending charts for a given date and location.  Charts contain information such as title, description, source, a jumpFactory, etc.
* [categoryTopCharts](###categoryTopCharts()): returns the top trending charts for a given category, date, and location.

###Promises
By default, all the API's return a promise for the results.  Example:
```
googleTrends.topRelated({keywords: 'dog house'})
.then(function(results){
	console.log("Here are the results!");
})
.catch(function(err){
	console.error('We have an error!', err);
})
```

Would console.log:
```
Here are the results! [ { 'dog house grill': 'Breakout',
    'best house dog': '+170%',
    'the dog house': '+140%',
    'the house': '+130%',
    'house of dog': '+100%',
    'large dog house': '+90%',
    'house train dog': '+80%',
    'small dog house': '+80%',
    'animal house': '+70%',
    'big dog house': '+70%' } ];
```

###Callbacks
Support for callbacks rather than promises coming soon!  Please check back

###Examples
The examples shown for each API method can be run by changing into the home `google-trends` directory and running `node examples.js`.  **Note:** Each example in `examples.js` need to be uncommented.

###topRelated()
*Returns the top related keywords for a provided keyword or an array of keywords*

####Syntax
`googleTrends.topRelated(['keywords'], 'country')`

`['keywords']` is either an array of keywords as strings or a string with one keyword.  Entering a keyword is **required**.
`country` is an optional string for the country.  Although the library can figure our the country from a formal name, it is preferred that the country is provided as a country code, for example, 'united states' should be provided as 'US', 'japan' should be provided as 'JP', etc.  If no country code is provided, 'US' is assumed by default

####Example
#####Input
`googleTrends.topRelated('dog house', 'US')` provides the top related keywords to 'dog house' in the 'US'.  Optionally, the input could have been provided as `googleTrends.topRelated({keywords: 'dog house', geo: 'US'})`.  Order of the keys does not matter and any other keys provided in the object will be ignore.

#####Output
```
[ { 'dog house grill': 'Breakout',
    'best house dog': '+170%',
    'the dog house': '+140%',
    'the house': '+130%',
    'house of dog': '+100%',
    'large dog house': '+90%',
    'house train dog': '+80%',
    'small dog house': '+80%',
    'animal house': '+70%',
    'big dog house': '+70%' } ];
```

###hotTrends()
*Returns the current top 20 trending searches for a given location*

####Syntax
`googleTrends.hotTrends('country')`

`country` is an optional string for the country.  Although the library can figure our the country from a formal name, it is preferred that the country is provided as a country code, for example, 'united states' should be provided as 'US', 'japan' should be provided as 'JP', etc.  If no country code is provided, 'US' is assumed by default.

####Example
#####Input
`googleTrends.hotTrends('US')` provides the top 20 trending searches in the 'US'.  Optionally, the input could have been provided as `googleTrends.hotTrends({geo: 'US'})`.  Any other keys provided in the object will be ignore.

#####Output
```

###allTopCharts()
